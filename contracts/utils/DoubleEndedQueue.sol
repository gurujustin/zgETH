 * @dev A sequence of items with the ability to efficiently push and pop items (i.e. insert and remove) on both ends of
 * the sequence (called front and back). Among other access patterns, it can be used to implement efficient LIFO and
 * FIFO queues. Storage use is optimized, and all operations are O(1) constant time. This includes {clear}, given that
 * the existing queue contents are left in storage.

 * The struct is called `Uint256Deque`. Other types can be cast to and from `uint128`. This data structure can only be
